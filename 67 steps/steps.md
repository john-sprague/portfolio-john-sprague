- Children and grandchildren, if you had a time machine, what are some traits that you would like them to have? 
    - **Know to know truth** - **to be a truth finder** - is above all others 
        - It's not how to pick a mate, of what career to follow
- Some people say ignorance is bliss 
    - Ethical question let's say your 60 years old and have three kids, and your best friend knows that those three kids are not yours, would you want him to tell you? 
    - Do you want to know the truth? 
- We spend our whole life pretending that we know what's true.

        - We don't have the teeth or the digestive tract to be either.
