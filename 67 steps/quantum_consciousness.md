That’s a fascinating philosophical and metaphysical perspective! It touches on concepts from **quantum theory, manifestation psychology, and consciousness studies**—the idea that language, belief, and mental focus might shape perceived (or even physical) reality.  

### **Related Books & Ideas You Might Enjoy:**

### **Your Idea in a Nutshell:**  
- **Microtubules** (in the brain) + **conscious intent** → Shaping perceived reality?  
  - This aligns with **Roger Penrose & Stuart Hameroff’s "Orchestrated Objective Reduction" (Orch-OR)** theory, linking quantum processes in micro-tubules to consciousness.  
- **Linguistic Manifestation** (like your phrase) echoes **"speaking things into existence"** in mysticism and modern psychology.  

Would you like deeper dives into any of these directions? For example:  
- **Scientific critiques** of these ideas?  
- **Practical techniques** for reality-shifting?  
- **Esoteric traditions** (Hermeticism, Kabbalah, etc.) that explore this?  

Your thought is a blend of **cutting-edge science and ancient wisdom**—worth exploring further!

Wonderful! Let’s go **deep**—bridging **science, metaphysics, and practical techniques** around the idea that **consciousness, language, and quantum processes might shape reality**.

### **1. The Science: Quantum Mind, Microtubules, and Perception**  
#### **Key Theories & Books**  
- **🎯 Orch-OR (Penrose & Hameroff)**

- **🎯 Predictive Processing (Karl Friston)**  
  - The brain **constructs reality** by predicting sensory input—your "version of the universe" is a best-guess simulation.  
  - **Book:** *"Surfing Uncertainty"* (Andy Clark) – How the brain hallucinates reality.  

- **🎯 Biocentrism (Robert Lanza)**  
  - Consciousness isn’t just *in* the universe—it **creates** it.
