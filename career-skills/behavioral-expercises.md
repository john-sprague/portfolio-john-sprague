# Exercise 1 - Behavioral Problems 

As part of this week's class, we will be building our solutions to common Behavioral/ Leadership questions. As part of your foundational assignment, we'd like you to Behavioral Problems exercise (in Career Workbook) & build our responses to 3 questions that we will cover in the class:

1. Ice Breaker - Tell Me About Yourself

2. Project Experience - Tell me about a difficult technical challenge you encountered. How did you navigate it?

3. Motivation & Values - Why are you looking for a job?

You will find these exercises on your Career Workbook spreadsheet, located under the “My Account” section on UpLevel.


**Ice Breaker** - Tell me about your self 

- I'm John Sprague, my journey into tech started with a specific believe, technology has the power to genuinely improve people's lives and I've always had a passion to help people and I figure a career in technology would be able to scale that desire. 

I've spent the last 18 months as an entrepreneur working on a problem within my local community by connected people to the source of their food, know their farmers, and understand what it means to have sustainable agriculture.

Before my journey into sustainable agriculture, I have 4 years of experience in Front End, Full Stack and Systems engineering 

with a knack for turning complex problems into delightful user experiences. 

I worked for IBM, where I went from entry-level to Advisory developer in three years - where I was working on a customer facing high impact project named Red Hat Marketplace. 

I went on to become technical Team Lead, received an Outstanding technical achievement award for building a data analytics platform from scratch, and I was one of the code owners of our in house UX Library which saved developers 50+ hours per week of development time. 

Current Role: My main responsibilities are 
- 1. Data pipelines, data warehousing and data analytics. We were able to onboard 30+ companies onto our system, and had incredible flexible and performant data schema and I received an Outstanding technical achievement award for the accomplishment. 
    - Maybe it's not the number of client's but products --- or think about a different statistic 
- 2. Managing the UX library that over 40 engineers used on a daily basis. 
- 3. Leading a team of 6 engineers located globally, which includes collaborating with internal and external stakeholders, breaking down project requirements into user stories, eliminating obstacles for the team to efficiently complete their individual tasks, and connecting the user experience to business value as well as road mapping for future development.

Previous Roles as a Front-end engineer
- 1. Lead an initiative to increased test code coverage from 45% to 100%
- 2. Managed an initiative to build utilities for monitoring analytics and tracking event metrics in Segment & Amplitude
- 3. 

Why should you hire me? I have experience in the javascript ecosystem, analytics, data pipelines, leading a team and cloud infrastructure. I have an obsession to make sure our clients and customers have a delightful user experience.

**TODO** 
- Talk about impact of my work --- When I build the analytics platform, what was the impact of the platform. 
    - We were able to onboard 50+ companies onto our system and was able to make a flexible schema that allowed for high performant queries. 
        - High adoption rate?
    - It was the first of the kind usage and metering platform for IBM, it help streamline billing and usage behavior
    - The UX library saved developers 50+ hours of engineering time for our group each week
- Can talk about alignment with companies values
- Why I'm the best person for the role 


**Project Experience** 
I was one the team for less then 2 months and volunteered to pick an item in our backlog. This a very general, ambagious, and open ended question that asked, "How can a system store entitlement usage that will be used for analytic reporting?" 

I performed a technical spike to learn more about the data structure, usage access patterns, use cases and technologies. During my spike, I reached out to other teams withing the organization and outside of our group, to see if there was a similar solution that could build off, collaborated with various architects, prepared two different POCs and presented them to various stakeholders to get buy in, and eventually, received approval and additional function to build out the solution.

The team and I worked closed with the various stokeholds to build a data analytics platform that would support our use cases, which included a GraphQL server, serverless functions to ETL the data into a data warehouse. The data warehouse had a Star Schema Data model that would allow flexibility and high performant queries for our end users. We also had a reconciliation system that would periodically check our data for inconsistencies.

**Why am I looking for a Job** 
I have a desire to create delightful user experiences, solve complex problems, optimizing systems, and to work on a high impact teams.  I enjoy what I do for work and the value I can bring to the organization and at the end of the day, the value I can help to bring to out clients and end users, is important to me. 

I'd like to grow withing the company,lead another team, and work day by day to move up the ladder and become an architect

- Tech can help me connect a wider range of people.

**Why are you looking for a new opportunity?**

- Exposure to scale, more exposure to infrastructure. (things that are not present)
- Growth and development
- Can talk about why I moved to Bentonville
    1. I moved to Bentonville Arkansas because my Wife's family are 5th generation Arkansans and we wanted to move here to be closer to them and have kids who know their cousins, Aunts and Uncles.
