- Social meets ups on the team 

# Interview Preparation Template

- I'm John Sprague, with 4 years of experience in Front End, Full Stack and Systems engineering with a knack for turning complex problems into delightful user experiences. I've spent the last few years at IBM, where I went from entry-level to Advisory developer in three years - where I was working on a customer facing high impact project named Red Hat Marketplace. 

I went on to become Team Lead, received an Outstanding technical achievement award for building a data analytics platform from scratch, and I was one of the code owners of our in house UX Library which saved developers 50+ hours per week of development time. 

Current Role: My main responsibilities are 
- 1. Data pipelines, data warehousing and data analytics. We were able to onboard 30+ companies onto our system, and had incredible flexible and performant data schema. 
- 2. Managing the UX library that over 40 engineers used on a daily basis. 
- 3. Leading a team of 6 engineers located globally, which includes collaborating with internal and external stakeholders, breaking down project requirements into user stories, eliminating obstacles for the team to efficiently complete their individual tasks, and connecting the user experience to business value as well as road mapping for future development.

Why should you hire me? I have experience in the javascript ecosystem, analytics, data pipelines, cloud infrastructure and leadership experience leading a team and cloud infrastructure.

## Types of Questions 

**Situational Question** (A situational question is a question about a specific situation (like when you missed a deadline or resolved an interpersonal conflict). Questions like these are asked as a way of helping your interviewer determine how well you've been able to grow when it comes to the skillsets needed to handle various types of situations well. This template will help you add structure and clarity to your explanations so your strengths are demonstrated to your interviewer unambiguously and with compelling evidence.)

**Philosophy Question** Unlike situational questions, a philosophy question tasks you with explaining your high-level philosophy about a particular topic. This could be anything from describing your leadership style to your personal thoughts on dealing with adversity in general. This template will help you discover and articulate your perspectives as well as add situational evidence if/when appropriate. 

## 1. Leadership Profile

These questions are about who you are as a leader/manager. They seek to reveal and evaluate your approach to leading your team at a high-level, setting and keeping the vision, defining team culture and collective values, and the tactics you use to manage your team.

### Question: Tell me about a time when you gave feedback to someone holding back the team. 

**BRAINSTORM**
- As team lead, responsible for removing blocks so the team can work efficiently.
- An junior engineer was working very long on 1-3 point user stories, sometimes taking an entire week for work that should have been done in 2 days. 
- During a sprint, a senior developer on my team (let’s call them Alex) was consistently delaying code reviews by 2–3 days, causing bottlenecks.
 
Here’s a polished **STAR-method response** tailored for a **Tech Lead/Engineering Manager** role, focusing on mentorship and process improvement:

---

**SITUATION**  
During a sprint planning session, I noticed a junior engineer (let’s call them Taylor) consistently taking **5-7 days** to complete 1-3 point tickets (e.g., frontend form validation, API endpoint tweaks) that typically took others 1-2 days. This created bottlenecks in our workflow, delayed dependent tasks, and frustrated teammates who had to pick up slack.  

**TASK**  
My goals were to:  
1. **Diagnose the root cause** without making Taylor feel inadequate.  
2. **Provide actionable support** to improve their efficiency.  
3. **Adjust team processes** to prevent recurrence.  

**ACTION**  
1. **Private Empathetic 1:1**:  
   - Opened with curiosity: *“I noticed these tickets are taking longer than expected—what’s feeling challenging?”*  
   - Learned Taylor was:  
     - Over-engineering solutions (“I wanted to make it perfect”).  
     - Blocked by unclear requirements (e.g., chasing edge cases not in scope).  
     - Hesitant to ask for help due to fear of judgment.  

2. **Targeted Mentorship**:  
   - **Pair Programming**: Spent 1 hour pairing on their next ticket to model iterative development (MVP first → polish later).  
   - **Scope Clarification**: Taught them to ask during grooming: *“What’s the minimum acceptance criteria?”*  
   - **Timeboxing**: Introduced the “2-hour rule”—if stuck longer, escalate immediately.  

3. **Process Tweaks**:  
   - Added a **“Quick Questions” Slack channel** for low-friction help.  
   - Broke tickets into smaller subtasks (e.g., “Implement base validation → add error animations”).  
   - Scheduled **bi-weekly 15-minute check-ins** to preempt blockers.  

**RESULT**  
- Taylor’s ticket completion time dropped to **1-2 days** within 3 sprints.  
- Team velocity increased by **20%** as bottlenecks eased.  
- Taylor later shared: *“I didn’t realize ‘done’ beats ‘perfect’—now I feel more confident shipping incremental work.”*

### **Key Takeaways for Interviewers**  
1. **Soft Skills**: Framed feedback as collaborative problem-solving.  
2. **Scalable Solutions**: Mentorship + process changes (not just fixing one person).  
3. **Metrics**: Quantified time savings and team impact.  

**If Asked for Lessons Learned**:  
*“I assumed Taylor just needed technical guidance, but the real issue was psychological (perfectionism) and process gaps (unclear scope). Now I always ask ‘What’s blocking you?’ before jumping to solutions.”*  

Need to emphasize **technical leadership**? 
“I documented our MVP approach in our engineering playbook—now all juniors default to ‘smallest solution first.’”

## 2. PROJECT EXPERIENCE  
These questions are about the specifics of projects you have experience with. Questions like these seek to reveal several things such as the kinds of projects you're most experienced with, the technical depth you've reached in various areas, what you consider technically challenging, as well as what you find interesting (and disinterest).

### Question: Tell me about a difficult technical challenge you encountered. How did you navigate it?  
**Type of Question:** Situational Question  

Here’s a **STAR response** tailored for a **Full Stack Engineer** perspective, emphasizing hands-on problem-solving with scope creep and cross-team challenges:

---

**SITUATION**  
While building a React/Node.js dashboard for real-time analytics, my team hit a major roadblock:  
1. **Scope creep**: The product team kept adding new chart types (heatmaps, drill-downs) after development started.  
2. **Missing APIs**: The upstream data team team’s aggregation API (promised for Sprint 1) was delayed by 3 weeks due to  dependency issues.  

**TASK**  
As the full-stack owner, I needed to:  
1. Deliver a functional MVP without the delayed APIs.  
2. Prevent UI freezes with large datasets.  
3. Push back on non-critical features tactfully.  

**ACTION**  
**1. Mitigating Missing APIs (Backend Workaround):**  
- Built a **Node.js proxy layer** to:  
  - Mock missing API responses using cached historical data.  
  - Transform the final API’s expected JSON structure early so frontend work could continue.  
- Collaborated with data science to validate our mock schema matched their contract.  

**2. Tackling Scope Creep (Frontend Tradeoffs):**  
- Proposed a **feature toggle system**:  
  - Implemented core charts (bar/line) first using recharts,.s.  
  - Deferred forecasting to Phase 2 (used a placeholder UI with “Coming Soon”).  
- Documented all additions in Jira as new tickets tied to a post-MVP milestone.  

**3. Solving Performance (Full-Stack Optimization):**  
- **Frontend**:  
  - Implemented pagination and virtual scrolling with `react-window`.  
  - Added Web Workers to offload data processing.  
- **Backend**:  
  - Modified our Express API to pre-aggregate data (reducing payload size by 70%).  

**RESULT**  
- Launched MVP on time with **zero dependency on the delayed API**. Real API integration later took just 2 days thanks to the proxy layer.  
- Product team adopted our **feature toggle approach** for future projects.  
- **Key metric**: User engagement increased by 25% despite deferred forecasting.

### **Why This Works for Full-Stack Roles**  
1. **Technical Depth**: Shows backend (Node proxy) + frontend (React optimizations) skills.  
2. **Cross-Team Diplomacy**: Balances pushback (“Let’s phase heatmaps”) with collaboration (aligning mock schemas).  
3. **Business Impact**: Links solutions to user engagement metrics.  

**Lessons Learned**:  
*“I used to resent scope changes—now I see them as a chance to advocate for modular design. That proxy layer became a template for other projects!”*

## 6. ICE-BREAKERS  

The point of these questions is to break the ice between you and your interviewer, and typically involve a segue into deeper conversations like an introduction to who you are at a high-level.

Look at this question a way of introducing yourself to your interviewer and setting the tone of your story. The goal is to give the interviewer a meaningful, high-level sense of your background insofar as they can see why you're interviewing for the role. A great way to do that is by covering a few details about your current situation and relevant past experience, then being explicit about your intent for bringing your learnings to the new role. 

### Question: Tell me about yourself.
