**How to know what questions could be asked?**  
Preparation is incredibly important

**Previous Interviews (Gather Data)**
- There are a million different ways to ask these questions. Keep track of questions asked in previous interviews and add to your tracker.  
    - Look at mission statements, know about the mission statement, know about the project, and be able to answer questions in a meaningful way.
    - Think about what the questions are, do a brain dump to make sure I can highlight the important aspects in my experience

**Recruiter**
- We want you to get the job. Just ask.  
  - What are some areas you have seen people fail at in this interview?  
  - Do you have any documentation to help me prepare?
    - Leet_code, videos, youtube channel, documentation, etc. 
  - Why is this job open, is it a new team, or why if it's a backfill, why did the previous people leave?

**Mimicry: Model of Emotional Contagion**
During social interactions, people tend to automatically align with, or mimic their interactor's facial expressions, vocalizations, postures and other bodily states. Automatic mimicry might be implicated in empathy and affiliation and is impaired in several pathologies

**Example:**
When around a group of people laughing it almost become contagious each person feeding off each other. Or when we see someone that just did something extremely embarrassing we almost are embarrassed for them. This helps our self conscious with empathy.

**How to use this to your advantage and not a disadvantage:**
When we are giving examples about past experiences especially in behavioral interviews it's important to get the listener to experience it from your point of view. If you sounds excited and passionate about something, others will too feel that same excitement.

- Get the listener to experience from my POV
- Tonality, approach, and excited
    - If I feel deflated, pointer finger at other people, then that shows not well. 
- Take ownership and discuss what I learned in the process. 
    - Put guardrails in case the other team doesn't deliver on time, give my team extra time to deliver. 
- Show behavior of my abilities to navigate and to solve problems and conflicts

**Understand the Job Requirements:**
Tailor your responses to the specific skills and competencies required for the position. Review the job description and
focus on highlighting experiences relevant to the role.

**Use the STAR Method:**
This framework helps you provide a clear and organized response, allowing the interviewer to follow your thought
process.

- Showcase how I went above and beyond. 

**Be Specific and Detailed:**

- Find a balance between high level approach and being specific and detailed. 

**Quantify Achievements:**
Use numbers, percentages, or other measurable metrics to highlight the impact of your actions. This adds credibility and demonstrates the tangible results of your efforts.

- Data is important, I know how to measure success, I know about KPIs, etc.  
- Think about current experience, previous experience, and at the end, why I align to this job. 
- Why am I the best person 
    - I want you consider me as at top candidate and here's why... 
- This work that i'm doing is impactful for "this" goal
- Give the all the information they need but be concise 
- Trajectry, milestones, 

**Three bullet points** answer the question in three bullet points, and don't oversell. 
- What do I bring to the table 
    - 1. Leadership 
    - 2. Technical knowhow 
    - 3. I have experience in LLMs/deep learning

When asked a question I didn't prepare for, it's easier to draw on my experience

---

**12 Things to consider when building your examples**

**Highlight Transferable Skills:**
Emphasize transferable skills that are applicable to the position. Even if your previous roles were in different industries or functions, highlight skills that are universally valuable, such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership.

**Practice, but Stay Authentic:**
Practice your responses to common behavioral questions, but avoid memorizing scripted answers. Your responses should feel natural and authentic, reflecting your genuine experiences and personality.

- Don't ramble on questions I don't know how to answer. Stick to the framework

**Link Experiences to Company Culture:**
If possible, connect your experiences to the company's values and culture. Show how your past behaviors align with the organization's mission and goals, demonstrating that you would be a good cultural fit.

- When the interview asks "Do you have any questions for me?" 
    - It's always impressive to do my homework. 
        - Shoes that I take initiative and that i'm resourceful. 
- When presenting my self 
    - Talk about a personal story, and how I algn to their values, mission, and culture, it's important to them 
    - **Very impressive** 
    - Ask thought-full questions 
        - Give the interviewers a reason to remember you. It's a story, or maybe it's a demeanor, but make it memorable. 

Here is the extracted text from the image:

---

**Address the "Why" Behind Your Actions:**  
- In addition to describing what you did, explain the rationale behind your actions. This provides insight into your thought process and decision-making abilities.  

**Be Concise:**  
- While providing sufficient detail, be mindful of your response length. Aim for a balance between thoroughness and conciseness to keep the interviewer engaged.  

**Choose Relevant Examples:**  
- Select examples from your past experiences that are most relevant to the skills and qualities the interviewer is seeking. Focus on situations that align with the challenges you may face in the new role.  
    - Give examples withing my last 5 years of experience.
    - Be relevant - don't bring things up from college. 

**Be Positive and Professional:**  
- Even when discussing challenges or failures, focus on what you learned and how you improved rather than dwelling on the negative aspects.
    - Take ownership - work isn't always a perfect place. 

**Remember that behavioral interviews are an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and competencies through real-life examples. By carefully constructing your responses, you increase your chances of leaving a positive and lasting impression on the interviewer.**  

- Balance --- If it's my way or the highway, then I'm not going to get hired. 

---

**Common questions and best approach**

**What do you know about us?**
- DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!
- If you know know anything about the company then why would you want to work there
- Even if you know 100% know, still come with a good idea.
- Used their own company page, linkedin, crunchbase, builtin, or even Youtube.com to get a better idea.
**Example**
    - Interview at META, one of the values was building community. She talked about how she was a first generation immigrant and she talked about why community was important because most of her family, friends, are still in her country, so she used the platform to meet new people and become members in facebook communities. So why would she not want to work for facebook and help make them become successful. 
        - Talk about why I use the platform and why would you not want to make the company successful if I am a user of the product and I believe in the mission statement of building community. 
- Get a good sense of culture in the company - is diversity important. 

**What has you interested in us?**

- Talk about the company and NOT the job posting/position imaged. As a huge data person, I was
- We can see that you applied to the job and know you're interested
- Tie your excitement about the company to something
personal

**Example** I remember the day when I would use AskJeves.com as the go to place for our search engine. It wasn't until I came across Google search to see what I was truly missing. Since then, Google has expanded to places I would have never using excel on a daily basis. Now, it's only Sheets. I want to be a part of the next thing that Google will prevail in.

- Personal story, what's important to the business and what's important to me. 

--- 

**Common questions and best approach**
When explaining why you left a job, focus
on positive aspects such as seeking growth opportunities, a desire for new challenges, or alignment with the company's values and mission. Always frame your reasons in a way that emphasizes your professionalism and commitment to contributing positively in a new role.

**Why are you looking for a new opportunity?**
- It's okay to be laid off. Especially in this market.
    - Recruiters understand the market. But be ready to answer questions if they want to dig into the reason. 
    - It wasn't my fault 
- Don't make it about a person, management style, or anything negative about current work.
- Bad Examples:
    - "I left because my team members were lazy, and it was affecting my performance."
    - "I couldn't get along with my colleagues/boss, and the working environment was toxic."
    - "I left because I wasn't happy after just a few months, and it happened a few times."
