# Practice Problem 1:
1. Model data for these scenarios:

- A buy/sell marketplace (OfferUp)
- An app for streaming music and creating playlists (like Spotify)
- A homework platform

2. For each of the scenarios above, write a list of endpoints for a REST API

3. For each of these user error status codes, list two examples from the scenarios above that should return those errors:

400
401
403
404

4. List some problems or challenges you should consider when updating your API. What's the safest way to avoid these problems?

**Endpoints + Example Status Codes**

GET: /products?filters={...}

**400 Bad Request:**
  1. Creating a listing without required fields (query params) (e.g., missing title or price).  
  2. Sending malformed JSON when updating user profile.

`GET /products?`

```json
{
  "error": "Missing required params 'filters'
}
```

**401 Unauthorized:** 
- User did not provide a valid token
- Accessing user-specific messages without logging in.

 
`GET /products?filters={...}`

```json 
{
  "error": "Unauthorized: Please provide a valid API key or access token"
}
```

**403 Forbidden:**
- Occurs when the user is authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource
- Attempting to access another user's private messages.

`GET /products?filters={...}`
`Authorization: Bearer validUserToken`

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden: You do not have permission to access this resource" 
}
```

**404 Not Found:** 
- Requesting a listing that does not exist (e.g., `GET /listings/99999`)
- Requesting a user profile with a non-existent user ID. 


`GET /products/99999`
`Host: api.example.com`


```json
{ 
  "error": "Product not found"
}
```


GET: /product/{product_id}
GET: /user/{userId}
GET: /user/purchases
GET: /user/purchase/{purchase_id}

POST: /user 
POST: /listing
POST: /purchase

PUT: /update_listing 

DELETE: /listing/{listingId} 
DELETE: /user/{userId}

## List some problems or challenges you should consider when updating your API. What's the safest way to avoid these problems?

### **Common Challenges:**
- **Breaking Changes:**  
  - Removing or modifying endpoints, request/response formats, or authentication methods that clients rely on.
- **Backward Compatibility:**  
  - Ensuring existing clients can still function after updates.
- **Versioning:**  
  - Managing different versions of your API simultaneously.
- **Documentation Mismatch:**  
  - Keeping API documentation up to date with code changes.
- **Deprecation of Features:**  
  - Removing features that are no longer needed while providing a transition period for clients.

### **Safest Way to Avoid These Problems:**
- **Implement API Versioning:**  
  - Use URL versioning (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/`) or header-based versioning so that breaking changes do not affect existing clients.
- **Deprecation Strategy:**  
  - Clearly document deprecated endpoints and provide a timeline for their removal.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  
  - Implement rigorous automated tests (integration and regression tests) to ensure changes donâ€™t break existing functionality.
- **Clear Communication:**  
  - Notify users well in advance about upcoming changes and provide migration guides.
- **Backward Compatibility Layers:**  
  - Consider maintaining backward-compatible responses for a period of time or offering adapter endpoints to ease transition.
- **Incremental Updates:**  
  - Roll out updates gradually, possibly using feature toggles or canary releases to minimize risk.
