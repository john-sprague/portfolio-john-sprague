# Databases 

## Types of Databases 

### Interview Question

Imagine a user auth service which validates a username/password combination with a hashed value in the database. **What kind of database would you expect to use for persistence and why?**

For a **user authentication service**, a **relational (SQL) database** is typically the best choice due to the following reasons:  

**Solution:**

**Best Choice: Relational Database (SQL) – PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB**  
1. **Strong Data Integrity & Consistency (ACID Compliance)**  
   - Ensures user credentials and authentication records remain consistent and secure.  
   - Prevents issues like duplicate users, race conditions, or partial updates.  

2. **Indexing & Query Optimization**  
   - Fast lookups of usernames using **indexed searches** (e.g., `WHERE username = ?`).  
   - Password hashes are small, so storing and retrieving them is very efficient.  

3. **Support for Transactions**  
   - Ensures operations like account creation or password resets either fully complete or fail safely.  

4. **Security & Compliance**  
   - SQL databases offer **role-based access control (RBAC)** and built-in security features.  
   - Easier to meet security standards like **SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA**.  

**Alternatives & When to Use Them**

- **Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)**  
  - 🔹 **Use Case:** When speed is critical (e.g., session caching, rate limiting).  
  - 🔹 **Drawback:** Not as strong in data integrity (eventual consistency).  

- **NoSQL Document Store (e.g., MongoDB)**  
  - 🔹 **Use Case:** If authentication data includes complex, evolving user metadata.  
  - 🔹 **Drawback:** Weaker relational integrity for user-based transactions.  

**Final Recommendation**  
✅ **Use PostgreSQL or MySQL** for secure, structured authentication data.  
✅ **Use Redis (key-value) as a cache** for short-term session storage or rate-limiting.  

## Relational vs. NoSQL Databases: Key Takeaways

| Feature               | Relational (SQL) Databases | NoSQL Databases |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Structure**       | Table-based (rows & columns) | Flexible (documents, key-value, graph, wide-column) |
| **Schema**         | Strict, predefined schema | Dynamic schema (schema-less or flexible) |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical (scale up: bigger servers) | Horizontal (scale out: more servers) |
| **Transactions**   | ACID-compliant (strong consistency) | BASE model (eventual consistency) |
| **Best For**       | Structured, relational data | Unstructured, semi-structured, high-scale data |
| **Examples**       | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB |

### When to Use Each  

- **Relational Databases (SQL)**
  - When data integrity and consistency matter (e.g., banking, e-commerce transactions).
  - When relationships between data are complex and need JOINs.
  - For applications with well-defined schemas that don’t change often.

- **NoSQL Databases**
  - When handling large-scale, high-velocity data (e.g., real-time analytics, social media).
  - When data structure evolves frequently (e.g., content management, IoT).
  - When high availability and fast read/write speeds are more important than strict consistency.

### The 80/20 Rule of Understanding 
1. **SQL = Structured, NoSQL = Flexible.**  
2. **SQL = Strong consistency, NoSQL = Scalability & speed.**  
3. **Use SQL for transactions, NoSQL for big data and fast reads/writes.**  
4. **SQL scales up, NoSQL scales out.**  
5. **Most modern apps use a mix (polyglot persistence).**  

**Relational Databases** 

- Structure data, well defined. We know the values for each of the fields
- Store data in rows and columns
- Each row contains all the information about one entity and each column contains all the separate data points. 
- Columns are also known as attributes or fields. 
- Rows are known as records
- Especially important when you need to manage relations between tables. 

**Reasons to Use** 
- We need to ensure ACID compliance 
- Data is structured and unchanging
    - Easy to find
    - Easy to handle data that is structured 

### ACID Transactions

[SQL ACID Transactions:  A Detailed Breakdown](../foundations/system-design-foundation)

**Atomic - "All or Nothing"**

    Each transaction is properly carried out or the process halts and reverts back. 

**Consistent - "Maintaining Valid Data"**

    Transaction wil never endanger the structural integrity of the database. The database must move from one valid state to another without violating constraints.

**Isolated - "No Interference Between Transactions & Persistence of committed transactions"** 

    Transactions cannot compromise the integrity of other transactions by interacting with them while they are still in progress. Multiple transactions must not interfere with each other to prevent data conflicts.

**Durable – "Data is Permanently Saved"** 

    The data related to the completed transaction will persist even in the cases of network or power outages. If a transaction fails, it will not impact the manipulated data. 

## NoSQL Databases

**Common Types of NoSQL Databases**  

| Type | Description | Best Use Cases | Example Databases |
|------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Document** | Stores data as JSON or BSON documents | Content management, catalogs, user profiles | MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase Firestore |
| **Key-Value** | Simple key-value pairs (like a dictionary) | Caching, session storage, real-time data | Redis, DynamoDB, Riak |
| **Column-Family (Wide-Column)** | Stores data in columns rather than rows | Big data, analytics, time-series data | Apache Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB |
| **Graph** | Stores nodes & relationships between them | Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines | Neo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune |

### Key Takeaways
1. **Document:** Best for semi-structured data that changes often.  
2. **Key-Value:** Ultra-fast lookups, great for caching & real-time data. Mostly run in memory
3. **Column-Family:** Handles huge datasets with fast reads/writes (great for analytics).  
4. **Graph:** Best when relationships between data are important (e.g., social networks).  

### Top Reasons to Use a NoSQL Database

1. **Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)**  
   - Easily distribute data across multiple servers (scales out) rather than relying on bigger hardware (scaling up).  
   - Ideal for handling large amounts of traffic and big datasets.  

2. **High Performance & Fast Reads/Writes**  
   - Optimized for fast data access, often outperforming relational databases for specific workloads.  
   - Especially useful for real-time applications like caching, analytics, and recommendation systems.  

3. **Flexible Schema (Schema-less or Dynamic Schema)**  
   - No predefined table structure—data can evolve without migrations.  
   - Great for rapidly changing applications (e.g., content management systems, IoT).  

4. **Handling Large Volumes of Data (Big Data & Streaming)**  
   - Designed for massive datasets and high-throughput environments (e.g., social media, e-commerce).  
   - Efficient at processing unstructured, semi-structured, or high-velocity data.  

5. **Availability & Fault Tolerance**  
   - Many NoSQL databases replicate data across multiple nodes to ensure uptime even if some servers fail.  
   - Crucial for distributed systems and global applications.  

6. **Optimized for Specific Use Cases**  
   - **Key-Value:** Real-time session storage, caching.  
   - **Document:** Flexible, evolving data models (e.g., product catalogs, user profiles).  
   - **Column-Family:** Large-scale analytics, time-series data.  
   - **Graph:** Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines.  

### When to Choose NoSQL Over SQL
✅ **When you need massive scalability** (e.g., global applications, social networks).  
✅ **When your data structure is constantly evolving** (e.g., dynamic user-generated content).  
✅ **When you need high-speed performance with large datasets** (e.g., caching, analytics).  
✅ **When relationships between data are not a primary concern** (or are handled differently, as in Graph DBs).

## SQL Overview and Relation Algebra

Here is the extracted text from the image:

**Question:**  
Write a query that finds the average `fruit_pct` by contributor and displays it in ascending order.

**Table Sample Data:**  

| id | name       | launch_year | fruit_pct | contributed_by |
|----|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1  | Bruzz     | 2007       | 45        | Sam Malone   |
| 2  | Delightful| 2008       | 41        | Sam Malone   |
| 3  | Nice      | 2015       | 42        | Sam Malone   |

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT contributed_by, AVG(fruit_pct) AS avg_fruit_pct
FROM table_name
GROUP BY contributed_by
ORDER BY avg_fruit_pct ASC;
```
This query:
- Groups records by `contributed_by`
- Calculates the average `fruit_pct` for each contributor


**SQL Overview** 

- SQL is a declarative language - it expresses **what** to do (or what to query) **not how** to do it. 

### The 20% of SQL That Covers 80% of What You Need

If you focus on these key concepts, you'll quickly become effective with SQL. Here’s the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) version of SQL**—the essentials you must master.  

---

1. **SELECT – Retrieving Data (The Core of SQL)**
**Why?** You can’t do anything in SQL if you don’t know how to get data.  

✅ **Basic Query**  
```sql
SELECT name, launch_year FROM table_name;
```
- Pulls `name` and `launch_year` from `table_name`.

✅ **DISTINCT Projection**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, FROM table_name;
```
- Pulls unique names `name` from `table_name`.

✅ **Filtering with WHERE**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE launch_year > 2010;
```
- Gets all records where `launch_year` is after 2010.

✅ **Sorting with ORDER BY**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY launch_year DESC;
```
- Orders results by `launch_year` in descending order.

---

2. GROUP BY & Aggregations – Summarizing Data
**Why?** Helps answer "how many?", "what’s the average?", etc.  

✅ **Basic Aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
```
- Counts all rows.

```sql
SELECT AVG(fruit_pct) FROM table_name;
```
- Calculates the average fruit percentage.

✅ **Grouping Data**  
```sql
SELECT contributed_by, AVG(fruit_pct) 
FROM table_name
GROUP BY contributed_by;
```
- Groups by `contributed_by` and shows the average `fruit_pct` per contributor.

✅ **Filtering Groups with HAVING**  
```sql
SELECT contributed_by, AVG(fruit_pct)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY contributed_by
HAVING AVG(fruit_pct) > 40;
```
- Only shows contributors with an average fruit percentage over 40.

---

3. **JOINs – Connecting Multiple Tables**
**Why?** Most real-world databases have **multiple tables**, and you need to link them.  

✅ **INNER JOIN (Most Common)**
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
- Fetches names and order amounts where users and orders match.

✅ **LEFT JOIN (Include all users, even those without orders)**
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount 
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
- Returns all users, even those who haven’t placed an order (orders may be NULL).

---

4. **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE – Changing Data**
**Why?** Databases aren’t just for reading data; you need to modify it too.  

✅ **Inserting Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) 
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@email.com');
```
- Adds a new user to the `users` table.

✅ **Updating Data**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET email = 'newemail@email.com' 
WHERE name = 'Alice';
```
- Updates Alice’s email.

✅ **Deleting Data**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
```
- Deletes Alice’s record.

---

5. **Indexing – Speed Up Queries**
**Why?** If queries are slow, indexing **makes them fast**.  

✅ **Create an Index for Faster Searches**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```
- Makes lookups on `email` **much faster**.

✅ **Check Query Performance**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@email.com';
```
- Shows how SQL executes your query and if it’s using an index.

---

6. **Subqueries & CTEs – Writing Cleaner Queries**
**Why?** Lets you break down complex queries into readable steps.  

✅ **Subquery Example**  
```sql
SELECT name, launch_year 
FROM table_name 
WHERE launch_year = (SELECT MAX(launch_year) FROM table_name);
```
- Finds the most recent launch.

✅ **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) – Cleaner Queries**
```sql
WITH recent_launch AS (
    SELECT name, launch_year FROM table_name WHERE launch_year > 2010
)
SELECT * FROM recent_launch;
```
- Creates a temporary named result (`recent_launch`) for reuse.

---

7. **CASE – If-Else Logic in SQL**
**Why?** Lets you categorize data dynamically.  

✅ **CASE Example**
```sql
SELECT name, 
       fruit_pct, 
       CASE 
           WHEN fruit_pct > 40 THEN 'High'
           WHEN fruit_pct > 30 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS category
FROM table_name;
```
- Categorizes fruit percentage as **High, Medium, or Low**.

---

### Summary of What You Must Master
1. **SELECT** – Pull data, use `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
2. **GROUP BY + Aggregations** – Count, sum, average data  
3. **JOINs** – Connect tables efficiently  
4. **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** – Modify data  
5. **Indexing** – Speed up queries  
6. **Subqueries & CTEs** – Break complex queries into smaller steps  
7. **CASE** – Add conditional logic  

## SQL Operators: The Essential Guide

SQL **operators** allow you to filter, compare, and manipulate data effectively. Here’s a breakdown of the most important types of SQL operators that cover **80% of what you need**.

---

### 1. Comparison Operators (Used in WHERE Clauses)
These compare values and return `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=`  | Equal to | `WHERE age = 30` |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equal to | `WHERE status != 'inactive'` |
| `>`  | Greater than | `WHERE price > 100` |
| `<`  | Less than | `WHERE age < 25` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `WHERE score >= 90` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `WHERE age <= 50` |

✅ **Example: Find users older than 30**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

---

### 2. Logical Operators (Used to Combine Conditions)
These help refine your conditions.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AND`  | All conditions must be true | `WHERE age > 25 AND city = 'NYC'` |
| `OR`   | At least one condition must be true | `WHERE age < 18 OR age > 65` |
| `NOT`  | Negates a condition | `WHERE NOT status = 'inactive'` |

✅ **Example: Get users in NYC who are over 30**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30 AND city = 'NYC';
```

Operator    Description

**ALL**         The ALL operator is used to compare a value to all values in another value set.

**AND**         The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.

**ANY**         The ANY operator is used to compare a value to any applicable value in the list according to the condition.

**BETWEEN**     The BETWEEN operator is used to search for values that are within a set of values, given the minimum value and the maximum value.

**EXISTS**      The EXISTS operator is used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table that meets certain criteria.

**IN**          The IN operator is used to compare a value to a list of literal values that have been specified.

**LIKE**        The LIKE operator is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators.

**NOT**         The NOT operator reverses the meaning of the logical operator with which it is used. Eg: NOT EXISTS, NOT BETWEEN, NOT IN, etc. This is a negate operator.

**OR**          The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.

**IS NULL**     The NULL operator is used to compare a value with a NULL value.

**UNIQUE**      The UNIQUE operator searches every row of a specified table for uniqueness (no duplicates).

### 3. Arithmetic Operators (Used in Calculations)
Used to perform basic math operations.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `+`  | Addition | `SELECT price + tax AS total FROM products;` |
| `-`  | Subtraction | `SELECT price - discount AS final_price FROM products;` |
| `*`  | Multiplication | `SELECT salary * 1.1 AS new_salary FROM employees;` |
| `/`  | Division | `SELECT revenue / total_orders AS avg_order_value FROM sales;` |
| `%`  | Modulus (Remainder) | `SELECT 10 % 3;` → (Result: 1) |

✅ **Example: Calculate final price after discount**
```sql
SELECT name, price - discount AS final_price FROM products;
```

---

### 4. BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE (Advanced Filtering)
**BETWEEN** → Used for ranges.  
**IN** → Used for multiple specific values.  
**LIKE** → Used for pattern matching.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `BETWEEN` | Matches a range | `WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 30` |
| `IN` | Matches any in a list | `WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK')` |
| `LIKE` | Matches a pattern | `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'` |
| `NOT LIKE` | Excludes a pattern | `WHERE name NOT LIKE 'B%'` |

✅ **Example: Get users aged 18-30**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 30;
```

✅ **Example: Get customers from specific countries**
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK');
```

✅ **Example: Get names starting with 'A'**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```
(`%` is a wildcard, meaning anything after "A" is allowed.)

---

### 5. IS NULL & IS NOT NULL (Handling Missing Data)
Used to check for NULL values.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `IS NULL` | Checks if value is NULL | `WHERE email IS NULL` |
| `IS NOT NULL` | Checks if value is NOT NULL | `WHERE phone_number IS NOT NULL` |

✅ **Example: Get users who haven’t provided an email**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email IS NULL;
```

---

### 6. EXISTS (Check if Data Exists in a Subquery)
Returns `TRUE` if a subquery has results.

✅ **Example: Get users who have placed an order**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.user_id = users.id);
```
- If the subquery finds a matching `user_id` in `orders`, it returns `TRUE`.

---

### 7. String Operators (For Text Manipulation)
Used for working with string values.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `||` or `CONCAT()` | Concatenates strings | `SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM users;` |
| `UPPER()` | Converts to uppercase | `SELECT UPPER(name) FROM users;` |
| `LOWER()` | Converts to lowercase | `SELECT LOWER(email) FROM users;` |
| `LENGTH()` | Gets length of a string | `SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM users;` |

✅ **Example: Create full name**
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM users;
```

---

### SQL Operators Summary (80/20 Key Takeaways)

1. **Comparison (`=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)** → Filters rows based on conditions.  
2. **Logical (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)** → Combines conditions for better filtering.  
3. **Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)** → Used for math calculations.  
4. **BETWEEN, IN, LIKE** → Special filters for ranges, lists, and patterns.  
5. **IS NULL & EXISTS** → Handles missing data and checks if records exist.  
6. **String Operators (`||`, `CONCAT()`, `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`)** → Helps with text manipulation.

## SQL `CASE` Operator: The Must-Know Guide

The `CASE` operator in SQL is like an **IF-ELSE** statement. It allows you to return different values based on conditions, making your queries **more dynamic and readable**.  

---

### 1. Basic `CASE` Syntax
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE default_result
END
```
- **It evaluates conditions in order** and **returns the first matching result**.
- **If no conditions match**, the `ELSE` value is returned (if provided).
- **If `ELSE` is omitted**, `NULL` is returned when no conditions match.

---

### 2. Example: Categorizing Users by Age
✅ **Scenario**: You want to classify users as `Teen`, `Adult`, or `Senior` based on their age.
```sql
SELECT name, age,
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Teen'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'Adult'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END AS age_category
FROM users;
```
 **Output**
| name   | age | age_category |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Alice  | 16  | Teen        |
| Bob    | 35  | Adult       |
| Charlie| 70  | Senior      |

---

### 3. Example: Conditional Discounts
✅ **Scenario**: Apply discounts based on the total purchase amount.
```sql
SELECT customer_name, total_spent,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent >= 500 THEN '20% Discount'
        WHEN total_spent >= 200 THEN '10% Discount'
        ELSE 'No Discount'
    END AS discount
FROM customers;
```

---

### 4. Using `CASE` in `ORDER BY` (Custom Sorting)
✅ **Scenario**: You want to **prioritize** VIP customers when sorting results.
```sql
SELECT customer_name, total_spent
FROM customers
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent >= 500 THEN 1  -- High spenders appear first
        WHEN total_spent >= 200 THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END;
```
- Higher spenders get a **higher priority in sorting**.

---

### 5. Using `CASE` in `GROUP BY` (Grouping by Categories)
✅ **Scenario**: Count how many users fall into different age categories.
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Teen'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 64 THEN 'Adult'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END AS age_category,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM users
GROUP BY age_category;
```
---

### 6. Using `CASE` with Aggregate Functions
✅ **Scenario**: Get the total revenue for **online** and **offline** sales.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_type = 'Online' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS online_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_type = 'Offline' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS offline_revenue
FROM sales;
```
- This helps **segment totals dynamically**.

---

### 🚀 Key Takeaways for `CASE`
1. **Acts like an IF-ELSE statement** for SQL queries.  
2. **Used in `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions.**  
3. **Returns the first matching condition’s result.**  
4. **If no conditions match, returns `ELSE` value (or `NULL` if omitted).**  
5. **Great for custom sorting, categorization, and conditional calculations.**  

## Database Views

Here are the key takeaways about **SQL Table Views**:

1. **Definition**: A **view** is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. It does not store data itself but provides a way to simplify complex queries.

2. **Creation**: Use `CREATE VIEW` to define a view. Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
   SELECT id, name, email FROM customers WHERE status = 'active';
   ```

3. **Usage**: Views are used like regular tables in queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM active_customers;
   ```

4. **Benefits**:
   - **Simplicity**: Encapsulates complex queries for easier reuse.
   - **Security**: Restricts access to specific columns or rows by controlling what users see.
   - **Maintainability**: Centralizes logic, reducing redundancy in SQL code.

5. **Updatability**:
   - Some views **can** be updated if they meet certain conditions (e.g., contain a single base table, no aggregations).
   - Use `WITH CHECK OPTION` to ensure updates follow view constraints.
   - Example of an updatable view:
     ```sql
     CREATE VIEW customer_emails AS
     SELECT id, email FROM customers;
     ```
     Then you can update it:
     ```sql
     UPDATE customer_emails SET email = 'new@email.com' WHERE id = 1;
     ```

6. **Materialized Views** (in some databases like PostgreSQL & Oracle): Unlike regular views, these store the query result physically and need manual refresh.

7. **Dropping Views**: Use `DROP VIEW` to remove a view without affecting the underlying data.
   ```sql
   DROP VIEW active_customers;
   ```
Here’s the **80/20 breakdown** of **Materialized Views vs. Non-Materialized Views** (Standard Views):  

---

### Key Differences

| Feature              | **Materialized View** | **Non-Materialized View (Standard View)** |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**     | Stores actual data | Does **not** store data, only a query definition |
| **Performance**      | Faster queries (precomputed results) | Slower queries (data fetched dynamically) |
| **Freshness**        | Can become outdated; requires manual or scheduled refresh | Always up-to-date but recalculates each time |
| **Use Case**        | Best for improving performance on large datasets | Best for real-time data that frequently changes |
| **Update Mechanism** | Requires `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Automatically reflects changes from underlying tables |

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Materialized Views are Precomputed**  
   - They store actual data, making queries **much faster**, especially for expensive aggregations.  
   - Requires a refresh (`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`) to get updated data.  
   - Ideal for **reports, dashboards, and historical analysis** where real-time updates aren’t necessary.  

2. **Standard Views Are Dynamic & Lightweight**  
   - They don’t store data, just the query definition.  
   - Every time you query a view, it fetches fresh data from the underlying tables.  
   - Best for **real-time analytics and simplified query structures** where performance isn’t a major concern.  

---

### When to Use Each

✅ **Use a Materialized View when:**  
- Querying large datasets with heavy aggregations (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`).  
- You need faster reads and don’t require real-time updates.  
- You're optimizing performance in **data warehouses** like PostgreSQL, Oracle, or BigQuery.  

✅ **Use a Standard View when:**  
- You need **always up-to-date** data.  
- You’re dealing with frequently changing data (e.g., user session info, live transactions).  
- You want to **simplify complex queries** without additional storage overhead.  

---

### Example Code

**Standard View (Real-time, No Storage)**  
```sql
CREATE VIEW recent_orders AS  
SELECT id, customer_name, total FROM orders WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**Materialized View (Faster Reads, Needs Refresh)**  
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS  
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales  
FROM sales  
WHERE sale_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'  
GROUP BY product_id;
```
**Refreshing the Materialized View:**  
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales;
```

---

## Materialized Views vs. Summary Tables
- **Materialized Views = Stored Data + Faster Reads + Needs Refresh**  
- **Standard Views = No Storage + Always Fresh + Slower Queries**  
- **Pick the right one based on performance vs. freshness trade-offs**  

Yes, a **materialized view** is very similar to a **summary table** because both store **precomputed data** for faster querying. However, they have some key differences:  

### How They Are Similar
- Both **store data physically** (unlike standard views, which don’t).  
- Both improve performance by avoiding repeated expensive queries.  
- Both are used for **preaggregated or summarized** data, like sales totals or customer counts.  

### Key Differences
| Feature | **Materialized View** | **Summary Table** |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | A virtual table that stores query results and can be refreshed | A manually created table that stores precomputed data |
| **Update Method** | Uses `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` to update | Requires manual `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations |
| **Flexibility** | Can be **automatically refreshed** in some databases | Requires manual maintenance or scheduled jobs |
| **Use Case** | Automates caching of results for performance | Stores long-term summary data for reporting |

### When to Use Each
✅ **Use a Materialized View** when:  
- You need **automated refreshes** without managing table updates manually.  
- You're working with databases that support them (PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).  
- You want a **balance between fresh data and query speed**.  

✅ **Use a Summary Table** when:  
- You need **full control** over data updates and history.  
- Your database **does not support materialized views**.  
- You want to store **historical summaries** that don't need frequent updates.  

### TL;DR
✔ **Materialized Views are like automated summary tables** that refresh with a command.  
✔ **Summary Tables require manual updates but offer full control over stored data.**  

## Case Study 

### Interview Question
    Design a database for an ecommerce website. 

    Define the type of database you would use and why. Define entity and relationships that satisfy storage requirements. 

**Solution** 

Database Type: **Relational Database (SQL)**

**Why?**
- **Structured Data**: E-commerce websites typically deal with structured data like products, orders, customers, and payments, which fit well into the relational model.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures transactional integrity, which is crucial for operations like order processing and inventory management.
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server have robust tools, extensive documentation, and community support.
- **Scalability**: While NoSQL databases are often touted for scalability, modern relational databases can also scale effectively, especially with techniques like sharding and replication.

### Relationships Summary
- **Users** can have multiple **Orders**, **Addresses**, and **Payments**.
- **Orders** contain multiple **Order_Items**, each linked to a **Product**.
- **Products** belong to a **Category**, and categories can have a hierarchical structure.
- **Reviews** are made by **Users** on **Products**.

### Additional Considerations
- **Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns like `user_id`, `product_id`, and `order_id` to improve query performance.
- **Normalization**: Ensure the database is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Security**: Implement security measures like hashing passwords, using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, and encrypting sensitive data.

This design provides a robust foundation for an e-commerce website, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying.
## Alternative Solution
---

**Step 1 - Nature of Data (Dynamicity)**  

- Given that we have dynamic pricing structure and product descriptions we can approach storage in multiple ways:  
  - If dynamic fields are few in number and not directly queried, we can store them in MySQL BLOB types. Then we can de-serialize blobs at application level and create data models.  
    - **Drawback** of this approach is that any data migration may need to deserialize, inspect and then use data and it involves application logic in addition to database and hence latent.  
  - If above is not true and we see a lot of dynamic data then we can split databases and store dynamic entities in NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB) and use RDBMS only for transactions. This way transactional entities can have soft references to NoSQL entities and we need external resolutions (multiple queries and cache mix).  
    - **Drawback** of this approach is establishing and maintaining consistency between two database types.  
- Since we are starting out and most of the data schema is structured we can safely go with an RDBMS.  

---

Here is the extracted text from the image:

---
**Step 2 - Type of Database(s)**  

- As discussed in the last slide we can use hosted RDBMS such as Amazon RDS or MySQL.  
- In the future if there is a need to support more and more dynamic types, then we can migrate certain (or most) tables to a NoSQL database.  
- At an application / service level we can use an ORM framework rather than direct database access so as to abstract the underlying database from our applications.  
- Since we have less scale of traffic, initially we don’t need a separate OLAP database or complex ETL tools. We can run data aggregation via daily batch queries for reporting.  

---

### Steps to answer the question 

- The questions will be vague and open ended. It's a good idea to start with requirements analysis and to ask clarifying questions
- Propose a design progression that provides a two way door for evolving requirements 
- Be explicit on what is out of scope (OLAP, ETL, etc, long term storage)

---

**Requirement Analysis**  

- **What is the nature and scale of this eCommerce site? Is it a mature company or a startup?**  
  - Great question! - You can assume this is your own startup. Scale is < 10K users for now.  

- **What are we selling here? Any particular type of product?**  
  - Assume that you can sell almost anything that Amazon does.  

- **Who sells products on the site? Does my company sell it, or is it open for third-party sellers?**  
  - This platform should support both first-party as well as third-party sellers.  

- **What is the level of design we want to discuss here, given that we may have lots of entities and attributes that may span outside our discussion time?**  
  - We can focus on core entities involved in transactions. No need to go into too much detail around attributes. We can maybe provide a high-level idea of attributes and keys.  

---

When designing a database for an e-commerce website or any complex system, asking **clarifying questions** is crucial to ensure you fully understand the requirements and constraints. Here are some clarifying questions you can ask stakeholders or team members to refine the database design:

## Clustered Index vs. Non-Clustered Index

Indexes improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval in a database. The two main types are **clustered** and **non-clustered indexes**.

#### Clustered Index
- **Defines the physical order** of data in a table.
- Each table can have **only one** clustered index.
- Searching for data using a clustered index is **faster** because data is directly retrieved in the indexed order.
- Commonly applied on **primary keys**.
- Exa
mple: A clustered index on an **"OrderID"** column will store records in ascending order of OrderID.

#### Non-Clustered Index
- **Stores a separate index structure** that points to the actual data.
- A table can have **multiple** non-clustered indexes.
- Searching with a non-clustered index involves an extra lookup step, making it slightly **slower** than a clustered index.
- Commonly used on **frequently queried columns** that aren’t the primary key.
- Example: A non-clustered index on a **"CustomerName"** column speeds up searches for customers without changing the table's physical order.

### When to Use Which?
- Use a **clustered index** for **primary keys** or columns used in **range-based searches** (e.g., date-based queries).
- Use **non-clustered indexes** for **frequent lookups** on columns that are often filtered or sorted but aren't the primary key.

---

### When to Use a Clustered Index vs. a Non-Clustered Index

**Clustered Index:**
- **Best for:**
  - Columns that determine the physical order of data, such as **primary keys**.
  - **Range-based queries** (e.g., dates or numerical ranges) because data is stored sequentially.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  - Faster retrieval for queries that benefit from data being physically sorted.
- **Considerations:**  
  - Each table can have only one clustered index.  
  - Ideal when the access pattern involves scanning large contiguous blocks of rows.

**Non-Clustered Index:**
- **Best for:**
  - Frequently queried columns that are not part of the primary key.
  - Columns used in **filtering, sorting, or joining** that don’t benefit from the table’s physical order.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  - You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a table, allowing various query patterns to be optimized.
- **Considerations:**  
  - Slightly slower than clustered indexes for data retrieval since they involve an extra lookup step.
  - Ideal when you want to optimize specific queries without affecting the table's overall storage structure.

In summary, **use a clustered index for primary key and range queries** where the physical order of rows matters, and **use non-clustered indexes for additional columns** that are frequently filtered or sorted to speed up query performance without reorganizing the underlying table data.

## SQL Index Data Structures
Indexes in SQL databases use specific **data structures** to optimize data retrieval. The most common ones are **B-Trees, Hash Indexes, and Bitmap Indexes**.  

---

### B-Tree (Balanced Tree) – Most Common
✅ **Used in: Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes**  
✅ **Best for: Range queries, sorting, and large datasets**  

- **Structure:** A self-balancing tree where nodes maintain a sorted order.  
- **Efficient for:** `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `BETWEEN` queries.  
- **How it works:** The tree maintains a balanced height, ensuring logarithmic (`O(log n)`) search times.  
- **Widely used in:** MySQL (InnoDB), PostgreSQL, SQL Server  

💡 **Example (Creating a B-Tree Index in SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL):**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name ON customers (customer_name);
```

#### **Key Differences: Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Index B-Trees**  

| Feature              | **Clustered Index**  | **Non-Clustered Index**  |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Uses a B-Tree?**  | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Leaf nodes store** | **Actual table rows** | **Pointers to table rows** |
| **Row storage**     | **Physically ordered** by index key | **Stored separately** from index |
| **Lookup speed**    | Fast for range scans | Requires extra lookup (slower) |
| **Best for**        | **Primary key, sorting** | **Frequent lookups, filtering** |

---

#### **Example: Creating a Non-Clustered Index on `username`**
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
```
- This creates a **B-Tree index** on `username`.  
- The **leaf nodes contain pointers** to the corresponding row in the clustered index (or heap if no clustered index exists).  

---

#### **Key Takeaways (80/20 Rule)**  
✅ **Yes, non-clustered indexes use B-Trees** for fast lookups.  
✅ **Leaf nodes contain row pointers**, not actual table data.  
✅ **Best for speeding up queries on non-primary key columns** (e.g., `WHERE username = 'john_doe'`).  
❌ **Requires extra lookup steps**, making it slightly slower than clustered indexes.  

---

### Hash Index – Best for Exact Lookups
✅ **Used in: Hash-based indexing (e.g., PostgreSQL Hash Indexes, MySQL MEMORY tables)**  
✅ **Best for: Exact match lookups (e.g., `WHERE id = 123`)**  

- **Structure:** Uses a hash function to map keys to locations.  
- **Efficient for:** `WHERE column = value` queries but **not for range-based queries** (`BETWEEN`, `<`, `>`, etc.).  
- **Downside:** No sorting capability; performs poorly for ordered retrieval.  

💡 **Example (Creating a Hash Index in PostgreSQL):**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users USING HASH (email);
```

---

### Bitmap Index – Best for Low-Cardinality Columns
✅ **Used in: Data Warehouses (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL, some analytical databases)**  
✅ **Best for: Boolean or categorical data with few unique values**  

- **Structure:** Uses bitmaps (`0s` and `1s`) to represent indexed values efficiently.  
- **Efficient for:** Queries on columns with low cardinality (few unique values) like `gender`, `status` (`Active/Inactive`).  
- **Great for:** `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR` conditions in analytical queries.  

💡 **Example (Creating a Bitmap Index in Oracle DB):**  
```sql
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_status ON employees(status);
```

---

### Key Takeaways (Pareto Principle: 80/20 Focus)
1. **B-Tree Index** → Best for most queries (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`).  
2. **Hash Index** → Best for **exact lookups** but not range queries.  
3. **Bitmap Index** → Best for **low-cardinality categorical data** in analytical databases.  

### Deep Dive into SQL Indexing Strategies

Indexes are critical for optimizing query performance in SQL databases. Let’s break down different indexing strategies, when to use them, and key considerations.  

---

## Types of SQL Indexes & When to Use Them

### Clustered Index (Primary Index)
✅ **Best for:**  
- Primary keys and columns often used in **range-based queries** (`BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`).  
- **Frequently searched columns where sorting matters** (e.g., `ORDER BY timestamp DESC`).  

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The column has **frequent updates** (e.g., `LastLoginTime` on a high-traffic website).  
- You need multiple indexes on the same table (since only one clustered index is allowed).  

---

### Non-Clustered Index
✅ **Best for:**  
- **Speeding up queries on non-primary key columns** (e.g., `WHERE username = 'john_doe'`).  
- **Joins and filtering queries** where the indexed column is frequently used.  

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The indexed column has **low cardinality** (few unique values, e.g., `gender` with only `M/F`).  
- Queries **return many rows** (full table scans can be costly).  

---

### Unique Index
✅ **Best for:**  
- **Enforcing uniqueness constraints** (e.g., `email` in a `users` table).  
- **Optimizing searches on unique columns** (`WHERE email = 'user@example.com'`).  

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The column **does not require uniqueness** (e.g., `city_name` in an address table).  

---

### Composite (Multi-Column) Index
✅ **Best for:**  
- Queries filtering on **multiple columns** (e.g., `WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John'`).  
- **Sorting queries** involving multiple columns (`ORDER BY last_name, first_name`).  

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The index **includes too many columns**, increasing storage overhead.  
- The **query only filters by the second column** (indexes are left-to-right prioritized).  

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(last_name, first_name);
-- Speeds up: WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John'
-- But NOT: WHERE first_name = 'John' (since last_name comes first)
```

---

### Covering Index
✅ **Best for:**  
- **Speeding up SELECT queries** by storing **all queried columns in the index**, eliminating extra lookups.  

**Example:**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON orders(customer_id, order_date, total_price);
-- Optimizes: SELECT order_date, total_price FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123
```
- The index **already contains all required columns**, so the database **does not need to access the table**.  

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The indexed column list is **too large**, increasing index maintenance cost.  

---

### Full-Text Index
✅ **Best for:**  
- **Text search and keyword-based queries** (e.g., searching in blogs, articles, or product descriptions).  

**Example (MySQL):**
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_text ON articles(content);
-- Optimizes: SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(content) AGAINST ('database indexing');
```

❌ **Avoid when:**  
- The dataset is **small**, as a normal `LIKE` query might be sufficient.  

---

## 2. How to Choose the Right Indexing Strategy?
Use the **80/20 rule (Pareto Principle)**:  
✅ **Focus indexing on the 20% of queries that drive 80% of database load.**  

**Decision-Making Flow:**  
1️⃣ **Primary Key?** → **Clustered Index**  
2️⃣ **Frequent Filtering (`WHERE`)?** → **Non-Clustered Index**  
3️⃣ **Enforcing Uniqueness?** → **Unique Index**  
4️⃣ **Multi-Column Filtering?** → **Composite Index**  
5️⃣ **Speeding Up Reads (No Lookups)?** → **Covering Index**  
6️⃣ **Keyword-Based Search?** → **Full-Text Index**  

---

## 3. Best Practices for Indexing
✅ **Index high-cardinality columns (many unique values)** for best performance.  
✅ **Limit the number of indexes**—too many slow down inserts/updates.  
✅ **Use the `EXPLAIN` command** (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL) to check if queries use indexes efficiently.  
✅ **Avoid indexing columns with few unique values** (e.g., `gender`, `status`).  
✅ **Periodically rebuild/reorganize indexes** in high-write databases to maintain efficiency.  

---

### 4. Should You Always Index?
❌ **No!** Over-indexing **slows down inserts and updates** since each index must be maintained.  

## Algos 

1. **Selection**: Which rows do you want
2. **Projection**: Which columns do you want 
3. **Joins**

---

## DB Sharding vs. Partitioning 

In SQL databases, **sharding** and **partitioning** are both strategies to manage large datasets, but they address scalability and performance in distinct ways. Here's a structured comparison:

---

### 1. Partitioning
**Definition**:  
Partitioning divides a single database table into smaller, more manageable segments (partitions) **within the same database instance**. Each partition stores a subset of the data based on a rule (e.g., range, list, or hash).

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Scope**: Operates within a single database/server.
- **Types**:
  - **Horizontal Partitioning**: Splits rows (e.g., by date range: `orders_2023`, `orders_2024`).
  - **Vertical Partitioning**: Splits columns (e.g., separating user profiles and login credentials).
- **Transparency**: Managed by the database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Applications query the table as if it were whole.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Faster queries on subsets of data (e.g., time-based analytics).
  - Easier data archiving (e.g., dropping old partitions).

#### Example:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Create a range-partitioned table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

CREATE TABLE orders_2023 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');
```

#### Pros:
- Simplifies query performance for filtered data (e.g., `WHERE order_date BETWEEN ...`).
- Minimal application changes.
- Maintains ACID transactions across partitions.

#### Cons:
- Limited to the resources of a single server.
- Does not inherently solve write scalability.

---

### 2. Sharding
**Definition**:  
Sharding distributes data across **multiple database instances/servers** (shards). Each shard is an independent database holding a subset of the data, typically split by a shard key (e.g., user ID or geographic region).

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Scope**: Spans multiple servers/machines.
- **Transparency**: Requires application or middleware to route queries to the correct shard.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Horizontal scaling for massive datasets (e.g., social media platforms).
  - Reducing load on a single server (high read/write throughput).

#### Example: 
```sql
-- Shard 1 (User IDs 1–1000)
CREATE DATABASE shard1;
USE shard1;
CREATE TABLE users (...);

-- Shard 2 (User IDs 1001–2000)
CREATE DATABASE shard2;
USE shard2;
CREATE TABLE users (...);
```

#### Pros:
- Scales horizontally (add more shards as data grows).
- Distributes load across servers.
- Fault isolation (failure in one shard doesn’t affect others).

#### Cons:
- Complexity in managing distributed transactions.
- Joins across shards are inefficient or impossible.
- Requires careful shard key selection to avoid hotspots.

### Key Differences

| **Aspect**               | **Partitioning**                          | **Sharding**                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                | Single database/server.                   | Multiple databases/servers.            |
| **Scalability**          | Vertical (limited to server capacity).    | Horizontal (unlimited via shards).     |
| **Transparency**         | Managed by the database engine.           | Requires application/routing logic.    |
| **Query Complexity**     | Seamless (no code changes).               | Cross-shard queries are challenging.   |
| **ACID Compliance**      | Full support.                             | Limited (distributed transactions).    |
| **Use Case**             | Manage large tables, improve performance. | Scale beyond a single server’s limits. |

---

### When to Use Which?
- **Partitioning**:  
  - Optimize query performance on large tables.  
  - Divides data logically into smaller chunks.
  - Archive old data (e.g., time-series data).  

- **Sharding**:  
  - Handle massive datasets exceeding a single server’s capacity.  
  - Scale write/read throughput (e.g., global SaaS applications). 
  - Involves multiple servers and distribution of data.

---

### **Hybrid Approach**  
Some systems combine both:  
1. Partition tables within a shard.  
2. Distribute shards across servers.  

**Example**: A social media app might:  
- Shard by user region (e.g., `shard_eu`, `shard_na`).  
- Partition each shard’s `posts` table by month.  

---

### Summary
- **Partitioning** organizes data **within a single server** for performance and manageability.  
- **Sharding** distributes data **across multiple servers** for scalability.  

Choose partitioning for simpler, single-server optimization, and sharding for horizontal scaling of massive datasets.

### Stages of Query Processing 

1. **Parser and algebrizer**: Checks syntax, identify data types,  & permissions

2. **Query Optimizer & Execution Plan**: Determine the most efficient way to execute the query. Only works on local query optimization.

3. **Query Execution Engine and Results Retrieval**: Runs the plan and returns data efficiently. 

---

## 1. Database Permissions
Permissions define what a user or role **can and cannot do** in a database. They can be **fine-grained** (e.g., per column) or **broad** (e.g., full database access).  

### Common Types of Permissions  
| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **SELECT** | Read data from a table/view. |
| **INSERT** | Add new rows to a table. |
| **UPDATE** | Modify existing data in a table. |
| **DELETE** | Remove rows from a table. |
| **CREATE** | Create new tables, indexes, or databases. |
| **ALTER** | Modify table schema or other objects. |
| **DROP** | Delete a database object (table, view, index, etc.). |
| **GRANT** | Give permissions to other users/roles. |
| **REVOKE** | Remove previously granted permissions. |

💡 **Example (Granting Permissions in PostgreSQL):**  
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON orders TO sales_user;
```

💡 **Example (Revoking Permissions in MySQL):**  
```sql
REVOKE DELETE ON customers FROM junior_staff;
```

---

## 2. User Roles vs. Database Roles
**User roles** and **database roles** simplify permission management by grouping users with similar privileges.

### A. User Roles
- **A role is like a template for users** (e.g., "Admin", "Developer", "Analyst").  
- Users inherit permissions from roles.  
- Modifying the role updates all users with that role.  

💡 **Example (Creating a Role in PostgreSQL):**  
```sql
CREATE ROLE analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON sales TO analyst;
GRANT analyst TO john_doe;
```
Now `john_doe` has **SELECT access** to `sales`.

---

### B. Database Roles
- Some databases (like SQL Server) have **predefined roles**.  
- **Fixed server roles** → Apply to the entire database server.  
- **Fixed database roles** → Apply within a specific database.  

#### Common Database Roles (SQL Server Example)
| Role | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **db_owner** | Full control over the database. |
| **db_datareader** | Can read all data but not modify it. |
| **db_datawriter** | Can insert, update, and delete data. |
| **db_ddladmin** | Can modify schema (CREATE, ALTER, DROP). |
| **db_securityadmin** | Manages security settings (permissions). |
| **db_backupoperator** | Can back up the database. |

💡 **Example (Assigning a Database Role in SQL Server):**  
```sql
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER employee_user;
```
Now `employee_user` can **read** all data in the database.

---

## 3. Best Practices for Managing Database Permissions
✅ **Use Roles Instead of Assigning Individual Permissions** – Makes management easier.  
✅ **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege** – Give only the necessary access.  
✅ **Use GRANT and REVOKE Carefully** – Avoid over-permissioning.  
✅ **Regularly Audit User Permissions** – Remove unused accounts and privileges.  
✅ **Restrict Superuser/Admin Access** – Minimize `db_owner` and `superuser` roles.  

---

## 4. When to Use Each?
| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|-----------|
| A developer needs to modify tables but not delete data. | **Grant `ALTER` and `INSERT/UPDATE`, but not `DELETE`**. |
| An analyst should only view reports, not edit them. | **Use `SELECT` and `db_datareader` role**. |
| A junior employee needs to access only customer data. | **Create a role with `SELECT` on `customers` table only**. |
| A database administrator should have full control. | **Assign `db_owner` or `superuser` role**. |

---

### Summary (80/20 Rule)
- **Permissions** control what users can do (**SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.**).  
- **User roles** help manage privileges efficiently by grouping users.  
- **Database roles** provide predefined security structures (e.g., `db_owner`, `db_datareader`).  
- **Best practice:** Use roles instead of assigning direct permissions to users.  

---

### Database Permissions, User Roles, and Database Roles

Database permissions and roles are essential for managing security, restricting access, and ensuring users have the appropriate privileges to perform actions.

- **Best practice:** Use roles instead of assigning direct permissions to users.  

---

## **SQL Transaction Locks Explained**
SQL transaction locks control how multiple transactions access the same data to **ensure consistency, isolation, and integrity**. Locks prevent issues like **dirty reads, lost updates, and phantom reads** in a multi-user database environment.

---

### Types of Locks in SQL
SQL databases use different **types** of locks at various **granularities** (table, page, row, etc.):

1️⃣ **Shared Lock (S)**
   - Allows **read** access.
   - Multiple transactions can hold shared locks at the same time.
   - Prevents **other transactions from writing (modifying/deleting)** the locked data.
   - Released immediately after reading unless explicitly held.

2️⃣ **Exclusive Lock (X)**
   - Ensures that **only one transaction** can access the locked resource.
   - Prevents **both reads and writes** from other transactions.
   - Used when a transaction **modifies data** (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

3️⃣ **Update Lock (U)**
   - Prevents a **deadlock** when upgrading a **Shared Lock (S) to an Exclusive Lock (X)**.
   - Only one transaction can hold an **Update Lock** at a time.
   - If the transaction decides to update the data, the **Update Lock converts to an Exclusive Lock**.

4️⃣ **Intent Locks (IS, IX, SIX)**
   - Used by the **SQL Server Lock Manager** to indicate **intention to lock** at a lower level.
   - **Intent Shared (IS):** Signals intent to place a shared lock at a finer granularity (row or page).
   - **Intent Exclusive (IX):** Signals intent to place an exclusive lock at a finer granularity.
   - **Shared with Intent Exclusive (SIX):** Allows shared reads at a higher level while indicating an intention to place exclusive locks at a finer level.

5️⃣ **Schema Locks**
   - Used when schema modifications are taking place (`ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, etc.).
   - Prevents conflicting operations on database structures.

6️⃣ **Bulk Update (BU)**
   - Used for `BULK INSERT` operations.
   - Improves performance by reducing lock contention.

---

### Which Lock Ensures Exclusive Access?
✅ **Exclusive Lock (X)**  
An **Exclusive Lock** is the strictest lock, ensuring that **only one transaction** can access the page or row for the entire duration of the lock.  

- **Prevents other transactions from reading or writing** to the locked resource.  
- **Held until the transaction commits or rolls back**.  
- **Ensures data consistency** by avoiding conflicts between concurrent transactions.

**Example: Acquiring an Exclusive Lock**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = balance - 100 
WHERE account_id = 123;

-- The row with account_id = 123 is now exclusively locked
-- No other transaction can read or modify it until the transaction commits

COMMIT;
```
Until the `COMMIT`, any other transaction trying to access `account_id = 123` will be **blocked**.

---

### When to Use Exclusive Locks?
✅ **Ensuring consistency in critical updates** (e.g., banking transactions).  
✅ **When data integrity is more important than concurrency**.  
✅ **Preventing race conditions** in high-stakes operations.  

❌ **Downsides of Exclusive Locks**
- Reduces concurrency and **may cause blocking**.  
- Can lead to **deadlocks** if multiple transactions wait for each other’s locks.  


# MongoDB 

## What is MongoDB?  
MongoDB is a **NoSQL, document-oriented database** designed for scalability, flexibility, and high-performance data storage and retrieval. Instead of tables and rows (like SQL), it stores data in **JSON-like documents** (BSON format) with dynamic schemas, making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. 

---

## Key Features of BSON:
1. **Binary Encoding**:
   - BSON is a binary representation of JSON-like documents, which makes it more compact and faster to parse compared to plain text JSON.

2. **Extended Data Types**:
   - BSON supports additional data types that are not natively supported in JSON, such as:
     - `Date` (for storing dates and timestamps)
     - `Binary data` (for storing raw bytes)
     - `ObjectId` (a unique identifier used by MongoDB)
     - `Regular expressions`
     - `Timestamp` (for internal MongoDB use)
     - `Decimal128` (for high-precision floating-point numbers)
     - `JavaScript code` (with or without scope)

3. **Efficiency**:
   - BSON is designed for efficient encoding and decoding, making it faster to process than JSON in many cases.
   - It includes length prefixes for fields and values, which allows for quick traversal of the data structure without parsing the entire document.

4. **Lightweight**:
   - While BSON is slightly larger in size than JSON due to its additional metadata (e.g., length prefixes), it is still lightweight and optimized for storage and transmission.

5. **Interoperability**:
   - BSON is designed to be easily converted to and from JSON, making it compatible with applications that use JSON for data interchange.

### BSON vs JSON:
| Feature                | JSON                              | BSON                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Encoding**           | Text-based (human-readable)      | Binary (not human-readable)      |
| **Data Types**         | Limited (strings, numbers, etc.) | Extended (dates, binary, etc.)   |
| **Size**               | Smaller (no metadata)            | Slightly larger (includes metadata) |
| **Parsing Speed**      | Slower (text parsing)            | Faster (binary parsing)          |
| **Use Case**           | Data interchange                 | Storage and data interchange     |

## Mongo CRUD Operations 

Here are the **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in MongoDB with JavaScript examples using the MongoDB Node.js driver or MongoDB shell:

---

### 1. Create (`insertOne` / `insertMany`) 
Add new documents to a collection.  
**Example:** Insert a single document into the `users` collection.  
```javascript
// Insert a user
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  age: 30,
  status: "active"
});
```

---

### 2. Read (`find` / `findOne`) 
Query documents from a collection.  
**Example:** Find all users with `status: "active"`.  
```javascript
// Find all active users
const activeUsers = db.users.find({ status: "active" }).toArray();
console.log(activeUsers);

// Find a single user by email
const user = db.users.findOne({ email: "alice@example.com" });
console.log(user);
```

---

### 3. Update (`updateOne` / `updateMany`)
Modify existing documents.  
**Example:** Update Alice's age to `31`.  
```javascript
// Update a single document
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "alice@example.com" }, // Filter
  { $set: { age: 31 } } // Update operation
);

// Increment age by 1
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "alice@example.com" },
  { $inc: { age: 1 } }
);
```

---

### 4. Delete (`deleteOne` / `deleteMany`)
Remove documents from a collection.  
**Example:** Delete a user by email.  
```javascript
// Delete a single document
db.users.deleteOne({ email: "alice@example.com" });

// Delete all inactive users
db.users.deleteMany({ status: "inactive" });
```

---

### Full JavaScript Example (Using MongoDB Node.js Driver)
```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

async function main() {
  const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db("mydatabase");

    // 1. CREATE
    const insertResult = await db.collection("users").insertOne({
      name: "Bob",
      email: "bob@example.com",
      age: 25
    });
    console.log("Inserted ID:", insertResult.insertedId);

    // 2. READ
    const user = await db.collection("users").findOne({ name: "Bob" });
    console.log("Found user:", user);

    // 3. UPDATE
    const updateResult = await db.collection("users").updateOne(
      { name: "Bob" },
      { $set: { age: 26 } }
    );
    console.log("Updated count:", updateResult.modifiedCount);

    // 4. DELETE
    const deleteResult = await db.collection("users").deleteOne({ name: "Bob" });
    console.log("Deleted count:", deleteResult.deletedCount);

  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
---

### Key Notes 
- **`insertOne` vs. `insertMany`**: Use `insertMany` to add multiple documents in one operation.  
- **`find` vs. `findOne`**: `find` returns a cursor (multiple documents), while `findOne` returns a single document.  
- **Update Operators**: Use `$set`, `$inc`, `$push`, etc., to modify fields.  
- **Delete Safety**: Always use a precise filter to avoid accidental data loss.  

---

### Key Takeaways 
1. **Document Model**:  
   - Data is stored as **collections of documents** (similar to JSON objects).  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "123",
       "name": "Alice",
       "orders": [ 
         { "product": "Laptop", "price": 999 }
       ]
     }
     ```  
   - Supports nested data (arrays, sub-documents), reducing the need for joins.  

2. **Scalability**:  
   - Horizontal scaling via **sharding** (distributing data across clusters).  
   - Automatic load balancing for high-traffic workloads.  

3. **Flexibility**:  
   - Schema-less design allows dynamic changes to data structures without downtime.  

4. **Indexing**:  
   - Supports secondary, compound, geospatial, and text indexes for fast queries.  

5. **Aggregation Pipeline**:  
   - Powerful framework for data transformations (e.g., filtering, grouping, joining).  

6. **High Availability**:  
   - Built-in replication with **replica sets** (auto-failover for fault tolerance).  

7. **Use Cases**:  
   - Real-time analytics, IoT, content management, catalogs, and apps with evolving data models.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) in MongoDB 
The Pareto Principle states that **80% of results come from 20% of efforts**. Applied to MongoDB:  

#### 20% of Features → 80% of Results 
1. **Indexing**:  
   - Proper indexing (even on a few critical fields) eliminates 80% of slow queries.  
   - Example: Indexing `user_id` and `timestamp` for fast lookups.  

2. **Schema Design**:  
   - Denormalizing frequently accessed data (e.g., embedding vs. referencing) reduces 80% of read latency.  

3. **Sharding**:  
   - Correct shard key selection (e.g., `user_id` or `geo-location`) avoids 80% of scalability bottlenecks.  

4. **CRUD Operations**:  
   - Mastering basic `insert`, `find`, `update`, and `delete` commands covers 80% of daily use cases.  

5. **Aggregation Basics**:  
   - Using `$match`, `$group`, and `$project` handles 80% of data analysis tasks.  

---

#### 20% of Mistakes → 80% of Issues  
1. **Poor Indexing**:  
   - Missing or redundant indexes cause 80% of performance problems.  

2. **Over-Normalization**:  
   - Excessive joins (via `$lookup`) lead to 80% of complexity in queries.  

3. **Bad Shard Keys**:  
   - Choosing low-cardinality shard keys (e.g., `boolean` fields) creates hotspots.  

4. **Ignoring Write Concerns**:  
   - Not setting `writeConcern` or `readPreference` risks data loss or stale reads.  

5. **No Monitoring**:  
   - Failing to track metrics like **query latency** or **memory usage** hides 80% of inefficiencies.  

---

### Example: Pareto in Action
- **Effort**: Indexing the top 3 queried fields.  
- **Result**: Eliminates 80% of slow queries.  
- **Effort**: Denormalizing 20% of frequently joined data.  
- **Result**: Reduces 80% of read operations.  

---

### Conclusion  
Focus on **indexing, schema design, and sharding** to maximize MongoDB’s performance with minimal effort. Avoid common pitfalls like over-normalization and poor monitoring. By prioritizing these 20% of critical areas, you’ll achieve 80% of your database’s potential.

(Due to technical issues, the search service is temporarily unavailable.)

Absolutely! Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows you to process and analyze data in a pipeline of stages. Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline. Below are some common aggregation commands and examples in JavaScript.

---

## MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Stages
1. **`$match`**: Filters documents to pass only those that match the specified condition.
2. **`$group`**: Groups documents by a specified key and applies aggregate functions (e.g., `$sum`, `$avg`).
3. **`$sort`**: Sorts documents by specified fields.
4. **`$project`**: Selects specific fields to include or exclude in the output.
5. **`$unwind`**: Deconstructs an array field, creating a document for each element.
6. **`$lookup`**: Performs a left outer join with another collection.
7. **`$limit`**: Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.
8. **`$skip`**: Skips a specified number of documents.

---

### Aggregation Examples

#### 1. Simple Aggregation: Count Active Users
Count the number of active users.
```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "active" } }, // Filter active users
  { $group: { _id: null, count: { $sum: 1 } } } // Count documents
]);
```

---

#### 2. Group by Field: Total Sales by Product
Calculate total sales for each product.
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$product", totalSales: { $sum: "$price" } } }, // Group by product
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } } // Sort by total sales (descending)
]);
```

---

#### 3. Unwind Arrays: Analyze Tags
Unwind an array field (e.g., tags) and count occurrences.
```javascript
db.posts.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$tags" }, // Deconstruct tags array
  { $group: { _id: "$tags", count: { $sum: 1 } } } // Count occurrences
]);
```

---

#### 4. Join Collections: Orders with User Details
Join `orders` with `users` to include user details.
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: { // Join with users collection
      from: "users",
      localField: "userId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "userDetails"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$userDetails" }, // Flatten the joined array
  { $project: { orderId: "$_id", product: 1, user: "$userDetails.name" } } // Select fields
]);
```

---

#### 5. Pagination: Top 10 Active Users
Find the top 10 active users by activity count.
```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "active" } }, // Filter active users
  { $sort: { activityCount: -1 } }, // Sort by activity count (descending)
  { $limit: 10 } // Limit to top 10
]);
```

---

#### 6. Complex Aggregation: Average Order Value by User
Calculate the average order value for each user.
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$userId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$price" }, orderCount: { $sum: 1 } } }, // Group by user
  { $project: { userId: "$_id", avgOrderValue: { $divide: ["$totalSpent", "$orderCount"] } } } // Calculate average
]);
```

---

### Full JavaScript Example (Using MongoDB Node.js Driver)  
```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

async function main() {
  const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db("mydatabase");

    // Aggregation: Total sales by product
    const pipeline = [
      { $group: { _id: "$product", totalSales: { $sum: "$price" } } },
      { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } }
    ];

    const result = await db.collection("orders").aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
    console.log("Total sales by product:", result);

  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

---

### Key Takeaways
1. **Pipeline Stages**: Combine stages like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, and `$project` to build complex queries.
2. **Performance**: Use indexes to optimize aggregation pipelines, especially for large datasets.
3. **Flexibility**: Aggregation is ideal for analytics, reporting, and data transformation.
4. **Joins**: Use `$lookup` to combine data from multiple collections.


## Can You Partition a MongoDB?

  **Yes, you can partition data in MongoDB using **Sharding**. However, MongoDB does not support traditional table partitioning like SQL databases. Instead, it distributes data across multiple servers using a sharding mechanism.  

---

## What is Sharding in MongoDB?
Sharding is MongoDB's method of **horizontal partitioning**, where data is spread across multiple servers (**shards**) to improve **scalability and performance**.  

- **Each shard stores a subset of the data**, and together, they make up the complete dataset.
- MongoDB automatically routes queries to the correct shard based on a **shard key**.

### xample of a Sharded Cluster in MongoDB
- **Config Servers** → Store metadata about shards.  
- **Query Routers (mongos)** → Direct queries to appropriate shards.  
- **Shards** → Store actual partitioned data.  

---

### How Does MongoDB Partition Data?

#### Range-Based Sharding
📌 **Divides data based on ranges of values in the shard key.**  
✅ Best for **sequentially increasing** data like timestamps.  
❌ Can lead to **hotspots** where one shard handles most of the workload.  

🔹 **Example:** Partitioning based on user ID ranges  
```js
Shard 1: { user_id: 1 - 10000 }
Shard 2: { user_id: 10001 - 20000 }
Shard 3: { user_id: 20001 - 30000 }
```

---

#### Hash-Based Sharding
📌 **Applies a hash function to the shard key to evenly distribute data.**  
✅ Best for **avoiding hotspots** and ensuring even distribution.  
❌ Less efficient for range queries.  

🔹 **Example:**  
```js
Shard Key: user_id
Hash(user_id) → Determines shard placement
```

---

#### Zone-Based Sharding
📌 **Allows placing specific data ranges in designated shards (geographical partitioning).**  
✅ Best for **region-based** data partitioning.  
❌ Requires careful planning.  

🔹 **Example:** Storing U.S. customers in one shard, European customers in another.  
```js
Zone 1 → { country: "USA" }
Zone 2 → { country: "Germany" }
Zone 3 → { country: "India" }
```

---

### When to Use Sharding in MongoDB?
✅ **High write workloads** → Distributes writes across multiple shards.  
✅ **Growing dataset beyond a single server’s capacity**.  
✅ **Geographically distributed applications** → Store users close to their location.  
✅ **Evenly distributing query loads** to prevent bottlenecks.  

❌ **Avoid sharding if:**  
- Your dataset is **small** and fits on a single server.  
- Your query workload does **not require horizontal scaling**.  

---

### Key Takeaways (80/20 Rule)
✅ **MongoDB does not support traditional SQL partitioning, but you can partition data using sharding.**  
✅ **Sharding distributes data across multiple servers** for scalability.  
✅ **Choose the right shard key carefully**—it affects performance and balance.  
✅ **Range-based sharding is good for sequential data, hash-based prevents hotspots, and zone-based allows for geo-distribution.**  

## MongoDB Interview Questions 

1. **Atomocity**: MongoDB writes are **atomic** for a given document - even if there are multiple writes within that document. However, writes are **not atomic** across **multiple documents**. 

2. **Transactions**: There are libraries that can handle multi-document transactions. This happens through the transactions API. 

3. **Query performance/tuning**: MongoDB provides methods for getting stats on query performance. **Explain** is one of those methods to use on an existing query.
